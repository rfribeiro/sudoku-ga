# sudoku-ga
The idea of this project is to create a sudoku solver based on genetic algorithm.

The first version is a sudoku generator, that generates a complete sudoku using genetic Algorithm
the second version is a sudoku solver that based on an entered start sudoku tries to solve it using genetic algorithm
The third version tried to create a solver to solve larger sudoku. ex. 16x16 and 25x25

Below I explained how we create the solver.
